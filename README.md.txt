1. Download and unzip the file.

2. Place the "build" folder in your home directory (To access home directory press "COMMAND+SHIFT+H").

3. Open the "dist" folder and place the "MRMIKE.app" file in your "Applicaitions" folder (This may require an administraitor password).

4. If step "3" is not an available option (You were confused or you are not an admin) open the other folder located in "dist" called "Contents" then open "MacOS" and double click "MRMIKE" (After doing this it should run if you don't want to repeat this proccess select the Applicaition in the dock go to options and select "Keep in dock").

5. Have fun and enjoy!
